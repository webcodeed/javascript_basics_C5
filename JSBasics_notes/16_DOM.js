// DOM -> Document Object Model
// JavaScript can modify the elements on the page by creating and accessing an object called the DOM
// According to the Document Object Model (DOM), every HTML tag is an object. Nested tags are “children” of the enclosing one. The text inside a tag is an object as well.
// At the top of the DOM itself is the document object which nests everything else
/*
<html> = document.documentElement
The topmost document node is document.documentElement. That’s the DOM node of the <html> tag.

<body> = document.body
Another widely used DOM node is the <body> element – document.body.

<head> = document.head
The <head> tag is available as document.head.
*/

// ACCESSING THE DOM
// document.querySelector() and document.querySelectorAll()
